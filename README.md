# Dart Reduce() Method with Mixed Data Types
This example demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `reduce()` method in Dart with lists containing mixed data types. The `reduce()` method expects a function that takes two arguments of the same type and returns a value of that same type. When dealing with lists containing mixed data types, this can lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors.

The `bug.dart` file contains code that attempts to sum the elements of a list that contains both integers and strings.  This will cause errors. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a solution to handle these situations gracefully, ensuring type safety and preventing runtime errors.
